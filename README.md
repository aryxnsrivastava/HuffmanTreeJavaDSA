Utilized the Huffman coding algorithm to create a binary tree where characters are represented by variable-length codes, with frequently occurring characters having shorter codes for optimal compression.  
The implementation involved constructing the tree based on the frequency of characters in the input data, encoding the data using the generated Huffman codes, and decoding the compressed data back to its original form.  
This project showcases proficiency in object oriented programming data structures, algorithmic design, and practical problem-solving skills.
